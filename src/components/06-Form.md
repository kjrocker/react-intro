## Forms

My favorite example that ties everything together and illustrates an important point, is forms.

The form I've created here includes controlled inputs, custom submission behavior, error messaging that only appears once a field has been touched, and a few other nice features.

However, it's a lot of code. And this problem has been solved better by many MANY other libraries. `react-final-form`, `redux-form`, `react-simple-form`, etc. Use those instead of writing all this yourself!

Remember, React is just a UI library, not a complete framework. It doesn't provide everything, and if you need to reach out to other libraries that means you're doing it right.
